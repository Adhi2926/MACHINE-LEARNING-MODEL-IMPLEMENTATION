## I have done this program through 'VS CODE' which make some easy way to undersatnd, and i had installed matplotlab 
library to recognise the data . By the machine leaning model, i have made an food item implementation which i have intrested.
so, by defining the details in the programm i have corrected the data. And trained it in the right way of producing the output,
at last i have generated the data from the programm.
